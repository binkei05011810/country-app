# React Redux Typescript

This is the repository for typescript assignment

## Instructions

Convert your current frontend project to typescript:

1. [Adding typescript to react](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)

2. After adding typescript and start the project, you should see lots of error coming up. Follow the error and fix them one by one until there is no more typescript error

Some tips:

1. Always add a type for component props
2. Use either `type alias` or `interface`
3. `Types alias` or `Interface` that are commonly used across components can be in its own files. Otherwise, put the type within the same file where it's being used
4. Type your redux actions returns, reducers returns, and reducers state if needed
5. Most hooks in React can receive a type argument, use it to type your `state` or `params`
6. More references can be found in lecture slides
